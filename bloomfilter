When to use bloom filters
Bloom filters are a great first layer of filtering, since they don't require much space and
can fit in fast storage, like RAM. Consider using them anywhere where knowing if something
is definitely not present or possibly present would be helpful.

One common use is to eliminate unnecessary accesses to slower storage / expensive lookups.

For instance, say we wanted to query a large database stored on a rotating hard drive (slow to read from). And suppose the thing we're querying for has a good chance of not being present at all. Before querying the disk, we could check for the record in a bloom filter; if the bloom filter says the record definitely isn't present, then we don't need to touch the slow disk at all.
